Our project consists of main elements: creating a site, implementing a speech synthesizer module, and finally creating a chatbot responding to questions asked in speech.<br>
In the first half of our project we will use HTML and CSS, and Bootstrap to create a website with our project information and a space for our synthetizer and chatbot.<br>
In the second part of our project we will focus on implementing the speech synthetizer and creating a simple chatbot with JavaScript.<br>
