Our project consists of main elements: creating a site, implementing a speech synthesizer module, and finally creating a chatbot responding to questions asked in speech.

In the first half of our project we will use HTML and CSS, and Bootstrap to create a website with our project information and a space for our synthetizer and chatbot.

In the second part of our project we will focus on implementing the speech synthetizer and creating a simple chatbot with JavaScript.
